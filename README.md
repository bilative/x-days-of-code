## Hi
Actually most of my daily routine is going with coding around data science / data engineering. So I think that I can share some of them here.

* This is a hard 'find the x' question. And I think I wont find the x soon.
```python
for day in range(x):
    codeMore()
    andMore()
```

* The things I shared in this repo are only about what I search, waht I learn and what am I improving myself.
* I working on my side projects after working days and weekends. So frequency of the new things could may be low.
* Small steps are gonna be in this repo but big pictures is gonna be in their own repos. (I'll link them)
  
### **_Note: The codes I have shared are only sample of whole picture._**

I'll update my how my process is going [here](https://bilative.github.io/xdaysofcode). You can check it.
